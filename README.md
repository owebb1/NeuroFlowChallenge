# NeuroFlowChallenge

To handle the change of type of mood, I would change the way that it is read from the JSON format so that the data is pulled as a string or integer. This would cause it to be a easier fix than rewriting the type of the entire database.

If this were to enter production, I would have implemented a better template to login and incorperated the streak. I was not able to enter this part into my project as I purely ran out of time and I know that you needed this today. I would have liked to finish it to the full extent if it were to enter production.
